## Welcome! 

The *Data Scientist Nanodegree* program tackles topics such as building machine learning models, running data pipelines, designing experiments and recommendation engines, communicate effectively and deploying data applications. There ae four projects in this series.

_Project_1_: Analysis of 2020 Stack Overflow Developers Survey 

The project consists of choosing a subject of interest, find and analyze the data and write a nontechnical data science blog post. The process follows the CRISP-DM methodology. The 2020 Stack Overflow developers survey data is explored.

_The process follows the CRISP-DM methodology. In the first part, a Z-test for independent means is performed to compare the salaries between data and other developers. In the second part a machine learning model based on a RandomForestClassifier is used to predict job satisfaction for data developers. The work is done in a Jupyter Notebook, the code is written in Python 3 using NumPy and Pandas._

For this project, you will be creating a blog post and Github repository to begin building a data science portfolio of your own. You can gain some inspiration from Robert's posts here.

Come up with three questions you are interested in answering.
Extract the necessary data to answer these questions.
Perform necessary cleaning, analysis, and modeling.
Evaluate your results.
Share your insights with stakeholders.
Where to Start
There are two components that are required for project completion.

A Github repository for your code.
A blog post of your findings.
Your Github repository must have the following contents:

A README.md.
Your code in a Jupyter notebook, with appropriate comments, analysis, and documentation.
You may also provide any other necessary documentation you find necessary. Your blog must provide the following:

A clear and engaging title and image.
Your questions of interest.
Your findings for those questions with a supporting statistic(s), table, or visual.
The purpose of this project is for you to show off your technical skills, but more importantly for you to begin putting together a portfolio that shows your ability to effectively communicate technical results. Your technical skills will be built up as the program progresses, but for this project the main focus should be on communicating effectively the results of your analysis.

In this project follow the RUBRIC to assure you meet all of the necessary criteria for communicating your findings both as a developer and as a business professional.
