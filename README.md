## Welcome! 

The Data Scientist Nanodegree program tackles topics such as building machine learning models, running data pipelines, designing experiments and recommendation engines, communicate effectively, and deploying data applications.

## Write a Data Science Blog Post: Analysis of 2020 Stack Overflow Developers Survey

_Project_1_: Use Scikit-Learn and regression to analyze a real dataset of housing prices in Boston. Build and optimize a model to predict the price of houses, based on their features.

I evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts and available on [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about the monetary value of a home. 

_The model uses a Decision Tree Algorithm. The work is done on a template Jupyter Notebook provided by Udacity. The code is written in Python 3 using NumPy and Pandas._

For this project, you will be creating a blog post and Github repository to begin building a data science portfolio of your own. You can gain some inspiration from Robert's posts here.

Come up with three questions you are interested in answering.
Extract the necessary data to answer these questions.
Perform necessary cleaning, analysis, and modeling.
Evaluate your results.
Share your insights with stakeholders.
Where to Start
There are two components that are required for project completion.

A Github repository for your code.
A blog post of your findings.
Your Github repository must have the following contents:

A README.md.
Your code in a Jupyter notebook, with appropriate comments, analysis, and documentation.
You may also provide any other necessary documentation you find necessary. Your blog must provide the following:

A clear and engaging title and image.
Your questions of interest.
Your findings for those questions with a supporting statistic(s), table, or visual.
The purpose of this project is for you to show off your technical skills, but more importantly for you to begin putting together a portfolio that shows your ability to effectively communicate technical results. Your technical skills will be built up as the program progresses, but for this project the main focus should be on communicating effectively the results of your analysis.

In this project follow the RUBRIC to assure you meet all of the necessary criteria for communicating your findings both as a developer and as a business professional.
